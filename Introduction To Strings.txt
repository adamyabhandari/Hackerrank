Question
The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
1. Sum the lengths of A and B.
2. Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
3. Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
Input Format
The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.
Output Format
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
